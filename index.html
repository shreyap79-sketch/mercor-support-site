        <pre class="question">Q1: My university told me I need you to sign my form I-983. Who should I send this to to get it signed?</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
          Form I-983 must be signed by the <strong>employer of record</strong> who supervises the training plan. Mercor does not sign I-983s.  
          I direct candidates to send the form to their hiring company/manager. If theyâ€™re unsure who that is, I ask them to check the
          <em>Contracts</em> tab or onboarding email, and Iâ€™m happy to escalate via <code class="inline">support@mercor.com</code> if needed.

        <pre class="question">Q2: Iâ€™m in the middle of my second week working with you all and itâ€™s Thursday now. You said I was supposed to get paid each Wednesday for the week prior. Why donâ€™t I see any money in my account?</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Payouts are processed on <strong>Wednesday</strong> for the prior weekâ€™s approved hours.</li>
          <li>Most banks post deposits in <strong>1â€“3 business days</strong>; funds commonly show Thu/Fri.</li>
          <li>If nothing posts by Friday EOD, I confirm payout details in their account and loop in support to trace the transfer.</li>

Hint: There are no docs about this. Our goal is to see how you reply without context.</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
          That path is deprecated. The correct flow is to upload the resume from the <strong>Applications</strong> tab after signing in.  
          If the upload UI still fails, I ask them to clear cache or try another browser. When needed, I request a fresh upload link from support.

      <article class="card">
        <pre class="question">Q4: Iâ€™ve referred 40 people to apply to Mercor roles, but havenâ€™t gotten any money yet. When will I get paid?</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
          Referral rewards pay only after a referred candidate is <strong>hired</strong> and completes the eligibility period (e.g., a minimum time worked).
          I have them open the <strong>Referrals</strong> dashboard to track the pipeline (Invited â†’ Applied â†’ In Process â†’ Hired â†’ Completed).
          Payout appears once a referral reaches <em>Completed</em>, assuming their payout method is set up.

Q1: We recently launched our Referrals dashboard and often get questions about referrals statuses, link functionality, and payout tracking. Prepare a small page we could host on our docs site about how to best navigate the Referrals dashboard.</pre>
        <h3>Answer (Docs page outline)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Open Dashboard:</strong> Log in â†’ left nav â†’ <em>Referrals</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Share Link:</strong> Copy your unique referral link and share it with candidates.</li>
          <li><strong>Status meanings:</strong> <em>Invited</em> (clicked link), <em>Applied</em>, <em>In Process</em>, <em>Hired</em>, <em>Completed</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Payout tracking:</strong> Rewards are queued after <em>Completed</em>; ensure payout details are configured.</li>
          <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If attribution is missing, ask the candidate to reapply using your link or contact support with their email for manual attribution.</li>

Q1: Using the Chrome Dev Tools, find the `interviewId` and `status` of your Talent Success Interview</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the <strong>Interviews</strong> page and press <span class="kbd">F12</span> to open DevTools.</li>
          <li>Go to <strong>Network</strong>, refresh once, and filter for <code class="inline">interview</code> (or view <strong>Fetch/XHR</strong> requests).</li>
          <li>Open the request that returns the interview list (e.g., <code class="inline">/api/interviews</code>).</li>
          <li>In the <strong>Response</strong> tab (JSON), read:
            <pre><code>{
  "id": "INTERVIEW_ID",         // interviewId
  "type": "Talent Success Interview",
  "status": "Submitted"         // status as shown on the UI badge
}</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>The status here is <em>Submitted</em>; the JSON also provides the unique interviewId.</li>

      <!-- App Debugging Q2 -->
      <article class="card">
        <pre class="question">Q2: When you update your work experiences on the Resume page, what internal endpoint is called and with which HTTP Method? Is this the right HTTP method to use, why or why not?</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>On the Resume page, edit a Work Experience item with DevTools â†’ <strong>Network</strong> open, then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
          <li>The request is typically to an endpoint like <code class="inline">/api/profile/experiences/:id</code>.</li>
          <li>The method used for editing is commonly <strong>PATCH</strong> (correct for partial updates).  
              <strong>PUT</strong> is acceptable if the entire object is replaced; <strong>POST</strong> is for creating a new record.</li>
          <li>Conclusion: <strong>PATCH</strong> is the right REST choice here because only selected fields are being updated.</li>

Hint: Due to Next.js caching, the server may return this data in the document itself, or it may make an API call to retrieve this.</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Network route:</strong> filter for <code class="inline">listing</code> and open the request (e.g., <code class="inline">/api/listings/:id</code>). Find <code class="inline">createdAt</code> in the JSON.</li>
          <li><strong>Page-data route (Next.js):</strong> search for <code class="inline">__NEXT_DATA__</code> in the page and locate the listing objectâ€™s <code class="inline">createdAt</code>.</li>
