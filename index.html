Roleplay
Weâ€™d like you to reply to a few questions from our user as if you were already hired in the role. These questions should be answerable based on our documentation and by making reasonable assumptions. 

Q1: My university told me I need you to sign my form I-983. Who should I send this to to get it signed?

Q2: Iâ€™m in the middle of my second week working with you all and itâ€™s Thursday now. You said I was supposed to get paid each Wednesday for the week prior. Why donâ€™t I see any money in my account?

Q3: When I go to https://work.mercor.com/upload-resume I get a 404 error, how do I get past this? 
Hint: There are no docs about this. Our goal is to see how you reply without context.

Q4: Iâ€™ve referred 40 people to apply to Mercor roles, but havenâ€™t gotten any money yet. When will I get paid?

Documentation
Q1: We recently launched our Referrals dashboard and often get questions about referrals statuses, link functionality, and payout tracking. Prepare a small page we could host on our docs site about how to best navigate the Referrals dashboard.

Application Debugging
Q1: Using the Chrome Dev Tools, find the `interviewId` and `status` of your Talent Success Interview

Q2: When you update your work experiences on the Resume page, what internal endpoint is called and with which HTTP Method? Is this the right HTTP method to use, why or why not?

Q3: Using the Chrome Dev Tools, what day and time did I make the job listing that you had applied to? 
Hint: Due to Next.js caching, the server may return this data in the document itself, or it may make an API call to retrieve this.
