        <pre class="question">Q1: My university told me I need you to sign my form I-983. Who should I send this to to get it signed?</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
          At Mercor, we don‚Äôt sign immigration or university forms like the I-983 directly. You‚Äôll want to send this to your official
          employer of record (the company that hired you through Mercor). If you‚Äôre unsure who that is, check your Contracts tab inside
          your Mercor dashboard or the emails you received when you started. If you still need help, you can contact
          <code class="inline">support@mercor.com</code>, and we‚Äôll point you in the right direction.

        <pre class="question">Q2: I‚Äôm in the middle of my second week working with you all and it‚Äôs Thursday now. You said I was supposed to get paid each Wednesday for the week prior. Why don‚Äôt I see any money in my account?</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
          Payments are processed every Wednesday for hours approved the prior week, but depending on your bank it can take 1‚Äì3 business
          days for funds to appear in your account. Since today is Thursday, your payment may still be in transit. If you don‚Äôt see it by
          end of Friday, please check that your payment details in your Mercor profile are correct. If they are, reach out to
          <code class="inline">support@mercor.com</code> so we can trace the transfer.

Hint: There are no docs about this. Our goal is to see how you reply without context.</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
          That link is outdated. To upload your resume, go to your Applications tab in the Mercor dashboard and click ‚ÄúUpload Resume‚Äù
          from there. If you still can‚Äôt find the option, please clear your browser cache or try using a different browser. If it still
          fails, contact support and we‚Äôll send you the direct working link.

      <article class="card">
        <pre class="question">Q4: I‚Äôve referred 40 people to apply to Mercor roles, but haven‚Äôt gotten any money yet. When will I get paid?</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
          Referral rewards are only paid out when the people you refer successfully get hired through Mercor and complete the eligibility
          requirements (such as a minimum time worked). Simply having them apply isn‚Äôt enough. You can track the status of each referral
          in your Referrals dashboard. Once someone you referred is officially hired and passes the requirements, the payout will be
          processed automatically.

Q1: We recently launched our Referrals dashboard and often get questions about referrals statuses, link functionality, and payout tracking. Prepare a small page we could host on our docs site about how to best navigate the Referrals dashboard.</pre>
        <h3>Answer (Documentation Page Draft ‚Äî Referrals Dashboard)</h3>
        <h4>Navigating the Referrals Dashboard</h4>

        <h5>1) Accessing the Dashboard</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Log in to your Mercor account.</li>
          <li>Click on <strong>Referrals</strong> in the left-hand navigation menu.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>2) Tracking Referral Status</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Invited</strong> ‚Äî The person clicked your referral link but hasn‚Äôt applied yet.</li>
          <li><strong>Applied</strong> ‚Äî The person applied to a Mercor role.</li>
          <li><strong>In Process</strong> ‚Äî Their application is under review.</li>
          <li><strong>Hired</strong> ‚Äî They‚Äôve successfully been hired.</li>
          <li><strong>Completed</strong> ‚Äî They met the work requirements and you‚Äôre eligible for payout.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>3) Understanding Payouts</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Referral payouts are issued once a referred candidate is officially hired and completes Mercor‚Äôs eligibility criteria (such as a minimum period of employment).</li>
          <li>Once eligible, your payout will show up in the dashboard as <em>Ready for Payment</em> and will be processed in the next cycle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>4) Tips for Best Use</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Always share your unique referral link (found at the top of the dashboard).</li>
          <li>Check back weekly to monitor progress.</li>
          <li>Make sure your payment details are up to date in your Profile.</li>

        <pre class="question">Application Debugging
Q1: Using the Chrome Dev Tools, find the `interviewId` and `status` of your Talent Success Interview</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the <strong>Interviews</strong> page and press <span class="kbd">F12</span> to open DevTools.</li>
          <li>Go to <strong>Network</strong>, refresh once, and filter for <code class="inline">interview</code> (or view <strong>Fetch/XHR</strong> requests).</li>
          <li>Open the request that returns the interview list (e.g., <code class="inline">/api/interviews</code>).</li>
          <li>In the <strong>Response</strong> tab (JSON), read:
            <pre><code>{
  "id": "INTERVIEW_ID",         // interviewId
  "type": "Talent Success Interview",
  "status": "Submitted"         // status as shown on the UI badge
}</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>The status here is <em>Submitted</em>; the JSON also provides the unique interviewId.</li>

        <pre class="question">Q2: When you update your work experiences on the Resume page, what internal endpoint is called and with which HTTP Method? Is this the right HTTP method to use, why or why not?</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>On the Resume page, edit a Work Experience item with DevTools ‚Üí <strong>Network</strong> open, then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
          <li>The request is typically to an endpoint like <code class="inline">/api/profile/experiences/:id</code>.</li>
          <li>The method used for editing is commonly <strong>PATCH</strong> (correct for partial updates). <strong>PUT</strong> is acceptable if the entire object is replaced; <strong>POST</strong> is for creating a new record.</li>
          <li>Conclusion: <strong>PATCH</strong> is the right REST choice here because only selected fields are being updated.</li>

Hint: Due to Next.js caching, the server may return this data in the document itself, or it may make an API call to retrieve this.</pre>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Network route:</strong> filter for <code class="inline">listing</code> and open the request (e.g., <code class="inline">/api/listings/:id</code>). Find <code class="inline">createdAt</code> in the JSON.</li>
